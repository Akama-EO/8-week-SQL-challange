## :avocado: Case Study #3: Foodie-Fi - Customer Journey

Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

###  Join the dataset using plan_id

```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    plan_id,
    plan_name,
    start_date
FROM subscriptions
JOIN plans USING (plan_id)
LIMIT 5
``` 
	
#### Result set:
| customer_id | plan_id | plan_name     | start_date |
|-------------|---------|---------------|------------|
| 1           | 0       | trial         | 2020-08-01 |
| 1           | 1       | basic monthly | 2020-08-08 |
| 2           | 0       | trial         | 2020-09-20 |
| 2           | 3       | pro annual    | 2020-09-27 |
| 3           | 0       | trial         | 2020-01-13 |

### Check the earliest and latest subsciption dates

```sql
SELECT 
    min(start_date) AS min_start_date,
    max(start_date) AS max_start_date
FROM subscriptions
JOIN plans USING (plan_id);
```

#### Result set:
| min_start_date | max_start_date |
|----------------|----------------|
| 2020-01-01     | 2021-04-30     |

***

###  Number of distinct customers in each plan

```sql
SELECT 
    plan_id,
    plan_name,
    count(distinct(customer_id)) AS subscriptions
FROM subscriptions
JOIN plans USING (plan_id)
GROUP BY plan_id, plan_name
ORDER BY plan_id;
``` 

#### Result set:
| plan_id | plan_name     | subsciptions |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| 0       | trial         | 1000         |
| 1       | basic monthly | 546          |
| 2       | pro monthly   | 539          |
| 3       | pro annual    | 258          |
| 4       | churn         | 307          |
