###  1. What day of the week is used for each week_date value?

```sql
SELECT 
    DISTINCT dayname(week_date) AS day_of_week

###  2. What range of week numbers are missing from the dataset? 
- To get the current value of default_week_format variable : SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'default_week_format';

```sql

###  3. How many total transactions were there for each year in the dataset?

```sql
SELECT 
    year(week_date) AS year_number,
    sum(transactions) AS total_transactions

GROUP BY year_number
ORDER BY year_number;
``` 
	
#### Result set:

    region,
    month_number,
    monthname(week_date) as month_name,
    sum(sales) AS total_sales

###  6. What is the percentage of sales for Retail vs Shopify for each month?

 - Method 01 - Using a window function
```sql
WITH cte_01 AS (
    SELECT 
        calendar_year,
        month_number,
        platform,
        sum(sales) AS sales_contribution
    FROM clean_weekly_sales
    GROUP BY calendar_year, month_number, platform
    ORDER BY calendar_year, month_number), cte_02 AS (
    SELECT 
        *,
        sum(sales_contribution) over(PARTITION BY calendar_year, month_number) AS total_sales
    FROM cte_01
)
SELECT 
    calendar_year,
    month_number,
    round(sales_contribution / total_sales * 100, 2) AS retail_percent,
    100 - round(sales_contribution / total_sales * 100, 2) AS shopify_percent

###  8. Which age_band and demographic values contribute the most to Retail sales?

```sql
SELECT 
    age_band,
    demographic,
    round(100*sum(sales) /
	(SELECT sum(sales)
	 FROM clean_weekly_sales
         WHERE platform="Retail"), 2) AS retail_sales_percentage
FROM clean_weekly_sales
WHERE platform="Retail"
GROUP BY age_band, demographic
ORDER BY retail_sales_percentage DESC;
``` 
	
#### Result set:
| age_band    | demographic | retail_sales_percentage |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| unknown     | unknown     | 40.52                   |
| Retirees    | Families    | 16.73                   |

###  9. Can we use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?

Let's try this mathematically.
Consider average of (4,4,4,4,4,4) = (4*6)/6 = 4 and average(5) = 5
Average of averages = (4+5)/2 = 4.5
Average of all numbers = (24+5)/ = 4.1428

Hence, we can not use avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year and sales platform, because the result will be incorrect if we use average of an average to calculate the average.

```sql
SELECT 
    calendar_year,
    platform,
    round(SUM(sales) / SUM(transactions), 2) AS correct_avg,
    round(AVG(avg_transaction), 2) AS incorrect_avg
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY calendar_year, platform
ORDER BY calendar_year, platform
``` 
	
#### Result set:
| calendar_year | platform | correct_avg | incorrect_avg |
|---------------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| 2018          | Retail   | 36.56       | 42.91         |
| 2018          | Shopify  | 192.48      | 188.28        |
| 2019          | Retail   | 36.83       | 41.97         |
| 2019          | Shopify  | 183.36      | 177.56        |
| 2020          | Retail   | 36.56       | 40.64         |
| 2020          | Shopify  | 179.03      | 174.87        |
