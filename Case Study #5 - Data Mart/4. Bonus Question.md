#### Region Analysis

```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
    region,
    sum(CASE 
            WHEN week_date BETWEEN date('2020-06-15') - interval 12 week AND date('2020-06-15') - interval 1 day
            THEN sales 
        END) AS before_sales,
    sum(CASE 
            WHEN week_date BETWEEN  date('2020-06-15') AND  date('2020-06-15') + interval 12 week - interval 1 day
            THEN sales 
        END) AS after_sales
    FROM clean_weekly_sales
    GROUP BY region
)
SELECT 
	region,
    before_sales,
    after_sales,
    after_sales - before_sales AS sales_variance,
    round(100.0 * (after_sales - before_sales) / before_sales, 2) AS variance_percentage
FROM cte
ORDER BY variance_percentage;
```

            THEN sales 
        END) AS before_sales,
    sum(CASE
