## :shopping_cart: Case Study #5: Data Mart - Data Cleansing Steps

In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the data_mart schema named clean_weekly_sales:

- Convert the week_date to a DATE format
- Add a **week_number** as the second column for each week_date value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
- Add a **month_number** with the calendar month for each week_date value as the 3rd column
- Add a **calendar_year** column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
- Add a new column called **age_band** after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value
- Add a new **demographic** column using the following mapping for the first letter in the segment values
- Ensure all null string values with an "unknown" string value in the original segment column as well as the new age_band and demographic columns
- Generate a new **avg_transaction** column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record

```sql
CREATE TABLE data_mart.clean_weekly_sales (
WITH cte AS (
SELECT 
    *,
    str_to_date(week_date, '%d/%m/%Y') AS formatted_date
FROM weekly_sales) 
SELECT 
    formatted_date AS week_date,
    extract(week FROM formatted_date) week_number,
    extract(month FROM formatted_date) month_number,
    extract(year FROM formatted_date) calendar_year,
    segment,
    CASE
        WHEN right(segment, 1) = '1' THEN 'Young Adult'
        WHEN right(segment, 1) = '2' THEN 'Middle Aged'
        WHEN right(segment, 1) in ('3', '4') THEN 'Retirees'
        ELSE 'unknown'
        END AS age_band,
    CASE
        WHEN left(segment, 1) = 'C' THEN 'Couples'
        WHEN left(segment, 1) = 'F' THEN 'Families'
        ELSE 'unknown'
    END AS demographic,
    round(sales/transactions, 2) avg_transaction,
    region,
    platform,
    customer_type,
    sales,
    transactions
FROM cte);
