## :shopping_cart: Case Study #5: Data Mart - Before & After Analysis

This technique is usually used when we inspect an important event and want to inspect the impact before and after a certain point in time.

Taking the week_date value of **2020-06-15** as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect.

We would include all week_date values for 2020-06-15 as the start of the period after the change and the previous week_date values would be before

Using this analysis approach - answer the following questions:
1. What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?
2. What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?
3. How do the sale metrics for these 2 periods before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?

- Important Notice: One simple mistake to keep in mind is that we need the data for 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15 using the WEEK function. We don't calculate this from the WEEKNUMBER function of 2020-06-15 by adding -3 and +3 to it. The reason for this is because it's only right when 2020-06-15 is the exact start of the week.

#### 1. What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?

```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        sum(CASE 
                WHEN week_date BETWEEN date('2020-06-15') - interval 4 week AND date('2020-06-15') - interval 1 day
                THEN sales 
            END) AS before_sales,
        sum(CASE 
                WHEN week_date BETWEEN date('2020-06-15') AND date('2020-06-15') + interval 4 week - interval 1 day
                THEN sales 
            END) AS after_sales
    FROM clean_weekly_sales
)
SELECT 
    before_sales,
    after_sales,
    after_sales - before_sales AS sales_variance,
    round(100.0 * (after_sales - before_sales) / before_sales, 2) AS variance_percentage
FROM cte;
```

#### Result set:
| before_sales | after_sales | sales_variance | variance_percentage |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| 2345878357   | 2318994169  | -26884188      | -1.15               |

#### 2.  What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?

```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        sum(CASE 
                WHEN week_date BETWEEN date('2020-06-15') - interval 12 week AND date('2020-06-15') - interval 1 day
                THEN sales 
            END) AS before_sales,
        sum(CASE 
                WHEN week_date BETWEEN date('2020-06-15') AND date('2020-06-15') + interval 12 week - interval 1 day
                THEN sales 
        END) AS after_sales
    FROM clean_weekly_sales
)
SELECT 
    before_sales,
    after_sales,
    after_sales - before_sales AS sales_variance,
    round(100.0 * (after_sales - before_sales) / before_sales, 2) AS variance_percentage
FROM cte;
```

#### Result set:
| before_sales | after_sales | sales_variance | variance_percentage |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| 7126273147   | 6973947753  | -152325394     | -2.14               |

#### 3. How do the sale metrics for these 2 periods before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?

#### A. Comparing metrics *4 weeks* before and after for each year

```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
    calendar_year,
    sum(CASE 
            WHEN week_date 
                BETWEEN date(concat(calendar_year, '-06-15')) - interval 4 week 
                AND  date(concat(calendar_year, '-06-15')) - interval 1 day
            THEN sales 
        END) AS before_sales,
    sum(CASE 
            WHEN week_date 
                BETWEEN  date(concat(calendar_year, '-06-15')) 
                AND  date(concat(calendar_year, '-06-15')) + interval 4 week - interval 1 day
            THEN sales 
        END) AS after_sales
    FROM clean_weekly_sales
    GROUP BY calendar_year
)
SELECT 
	calendar_year,
    before_sales,
    after_sales,
    after_sales - before_sales AS sales_variance,
    round(100.0 * (after_sales - before_sales) / before_sales, 2) AS variance_percentage
FROM cte;

```

#### Result set:
| calendar_year | before_sales | after_sales | sales_variance | variance_percentage |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| 2020          | 2345878357   | 2318994169  | -26884188      | -1.15               |
| 2019          | 2249989796   | 2252326390  | 2336594        | 0.10                |
| 2018          | 2125140809   | 2129242914  | 4102105        | 0.19                |

#### B. Comparing metrics *12 weeks* before and after for each year

```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
     calendar_year,
        sum(CASE 
            WHEN week_date BETWEEN date(concat(calendar_year, '-06-15')) - interval 12 week AND  date(concat(calendar_year, '-06-15')) - interval 1 day
            THEN sales 
            END) AS before_sales,
        sum(CASE 
            WHEN week_date BETWEEN  date(concat(calendar_year, '-06-15')) AND  date(concat(calendar_year, '-06-15')) + interval 12 week - interval 1 day
            THEN sales 
            END) AS after_sales
    FROM clean_weekly_sales
    GROUP BY calendar_year
)
SELECT 
	calendar_year,
    before_sales,
    after_sales,
    after_sales - before_sales AS sales_variance,
    round(100.0 * (after_sales - before_sales) / before_sales, 2) AS variance_percentage
FROM cte;
```

#### Result set:
| calendar_year | before_sales | after_sales | sales_variance | variance_percentage |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| 2020          | 7126273147   | 6973947753  | -152325394     | -2.14               |
